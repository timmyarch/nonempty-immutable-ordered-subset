## Challenge

Design and Implement a `NonEmptyImmutableOrderedSet<T>` type and data structure.

Implement `SelectionState`'s topping field as a `NonEmptyImmutableOrderedSet<number> | null` type.

When toppings are selected, the toppings div should have a red border. When toppings are all deselted, the div should have a black border.

Good luck!
